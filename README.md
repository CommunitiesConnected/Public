## Welcome to the Global Repo ##

Code can be added to this branch through codespaces in the [CODE] tab (Code -> Codespaces -> Create new Codespace/Use active codespace) in the branch landing page or 
through pulling the current branch, editing and pushing changes. Desktop download reccomended for ease of use. 

For structural integrity reasons, if code pushed does not compile, please branch the changes and detail that this segment is under construction. It is best git habit to notate the current
working branch for others in the repository to work from. Once you are comfortable with the changes made, you can merge branches that are backlogged.

If you are working in codespaces, branch each change before commits as codespaces does not automatically maintain version control for /main.
If you are unsure of where to push an edit, it is best practice to default to create a new branch. Once you are comfortable with the changes made, you can merge branches that are 
backlogged.
